Hey there! 

1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.500 
Before we get started, 

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.200 
we’ll quickly go over our learning objectives.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000 
In the following learning modules, 

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200 
we’ll be covering a version control system called Git. 

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500 
We’ll talk about the role version control plays 

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200 
in a development workflow,

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500 
why it’s important, 

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800 
and how you can get started. 

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.700 
In addition to Git, we’ll also be introducing Github. 

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.733
We’ll discuss the importance of including Github 

11
00:00:24.733  --> 00:00:26.000 
in your development workflow, 

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
exploring how you can collaborate with others 

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.900 
and backing up your projects through Github’s services. 

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.000 
Sound fun? 

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.367 
Let’s go!
